# TODOs

### Core Functionality Enhancements
1. **Implement Protocol-Specific Decoders**: Develop decoders for common protocols like HTTP, DNS, and ARP for more detailed packet analysis.
2. **Add Packet Filtering Options**: Allow users to set filters for specific IP addresses, ports, or protocols.
3. **Support for IPv6**: Ensure the packet sniffer can handle IPv6 traffic effectively.

### Performance and Scalability
4. **Optimize for High Volume Traffic**: Improve the efficiency of the packet capturing process to handle high network throughput.
5. **Implement Circular Buffer for Packet Storage**: To prevent memory overflow when dealing with continuous packet capturing.

### User Interface Improvements
6. **Develop a Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Create a user-friendly CLI to control the sniffer and display results in a more structured format.
7. **Add Real-Time Packet Visualization**: Introduce a feature for real-time graphical representation of network traffic.

### Security and Compliance
8. **Implement Secure Data Handling Practices**: Ensure that captured data is handled securely and complies with privacy laws and guidelines.
9. **Add User Authentication for Access Control**: Integrate user authentication to restrict access to the packet sniffer.

### Testing and Documentation
10. **Write Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Develop a suite of unit tests to ensure the reliability and stability of your code.
11. **Create Detailed Documentation**: Document the codebase and provide a user manual or guide.

### Deployment and Compatibility
12. **Containerize the Application**: Use Docker or a similar tool to containerize the sniffer for easy deployment.
13. **Ensure Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Test and adapt the code to ensure it runs smoothly on different platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS).

### Community and Contribution
14. **Set Up a Contribution Guideline**: Establish guidelines for others to contribute to the project.
15. **Implement Localization Support**: Add support for multiple languages to make the tool accessible to a broader audience.

### Advanced Features
16. **Add Support for Packet Reconstruction**: Implement features to reconstruct sessions or files from packet data.
17. **Integrate with External APIs**: Consider integrating with external APIs for advanced data analysis or threat detection.

### Maintenance and Support
18. **Regularly Update Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated to the latest versions for security and performance.
19. **Set Up a System for User Feedback**: Implement a system for users to report bugs or suggest features.
